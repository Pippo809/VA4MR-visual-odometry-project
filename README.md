# VA4MR-visual-odometry-project
by  Roberto Pellerito, Giacomo Manzoni , Lorenzo Piglia
The goal of this mini-project is to implement a simple, monocular, visual odometry (VO) pipeline
with the most essential features: initialization of 3D landmarks, keypoint tracking between two
frames, pose estimation using established 2D â†” 3D correspondences, and triangulation of new land-
marks. During the exercises, you have seen some building blocks for this, now it is time to put
everything together!
